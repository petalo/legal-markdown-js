# Enhanced AST Cross-References Demo

This document demonstrates the new AST-based cross-reference system with custom
reference nodes.

## Contract Terms |contract_terms|

The contract terms defined in |contract_terms| establish the foundation for this
agreement.

### Payment Schedule |payment_schedule|

Payment schedule outlined in |payment_schedule| references the |contract_terms|.

#### Late Payment |late_payment|

Late payment provisions in |late_payment| are governed by |contract_terms| and
|payment_schedule|.

##### Interest Calculation |interest_calc|

Interest calculation method in |interest_calc| applies when |late_payment|
conditions are met.

###### Collection Procedures |collection|

Collection procedures in |collection| follow |late_payment| and |interest_calc|
provisions.

## Complex References

This section demonstrates complex cross-referencing:

- Primary terms: |contract_terms|
- Payment details: |payment_schedule|
- Late fees: |late_payment|
- Interest: |interest_calc|
- Collections: |collection|

All sections work together as defined in |contract_terms| to create a
comprehensive agreement framework.

## Metadata Fallback

The system also supports metadata references like |client_name| and
|contract_amount| for backward compatibility.
