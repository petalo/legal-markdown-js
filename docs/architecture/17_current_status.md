## Known Limitations

### Current Limitations

```yaml
Technical Limitations:
  - Large file processing (>10MB) may require streaming (planned v2.16.x)
  - Complex nested loops have performance impact
  - PDF generation requires headless browser
  - Plugin system is basic (enhanced in v2.15.x)

Platform Limitations:
  - Web workers not supported in all browsers
  - Some Node.js features unavailable in browser
  - PDF generation not available in pure browser mode
  - File system operations limited in web environment

Feature Gaps:
  - No built-in spell checking
  - Limited collaborative editing features
  - No real-time synchronization
  - Template debugging could be improved
```

### Workarounds and Mitigation

- **Large Files**: Use batch processing or file chunking
- **Performance**: Enable caching and optimize template complexity
- **Browser PDF**: Use server-side generation or alternative formats
- **Collaboration**: Use external tools for real-time collaboration
